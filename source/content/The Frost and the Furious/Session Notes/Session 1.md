# Beginning of the Quest

The following of the [[The Broken Tusk]] years have gotten longer and colder. Food has been harder to find and the following has continued to shrink. Every year the Tusks come together to celebrate the night of the green moon. You have been recruited to be scouts for the following. 

Your first task: hunt down and make a meal worthy of the night of the green moon. With the aid of head scout [[Whippa]] it should be easy. [[Pocano]] is another scout joining you. He is everything a scout should be. 

We enter the woods and find a moose.

We engage the moose and once we get it close to death [[Pocano]] comes in and steals the kill. He begins taking off the horns and only carries though going back and taking nearly all the credit for the kill. The rest of us cart back the kill with [[Huug]] carrying double. 

We are the scouts called [[The Tip of the Spear]]. [[Grandfather Eiwa]] comes and tells us that [[Whippa]] gave a good report. In a few nights the light will mark us as true [[The Broken Tusk|Broken Tusks]] 

- We need to secure the [[Rock Loom]] site for the solstice
- Fill ceremonial vessels with water from the river
- Gather Tapir's to add to the heard.

He asks us to walk the well trod path to the site get a first hand look. If anything is amiss we should do what we can to right the issue. Defend ourselves from any attack but no need to clear out any animals. The [[Empyreal Lord]] will guide all dangerous creatures.

We choose to go and clear the site first. 

# Clearing the Rock Loom
Massive stones rise from the earth in a semicircle all stones in decent condition except for the raven stone which has been broken off. 

[[Maxim]] tracks some footprints that disappear and then reappear. We follow these as they head up towards a hill and we are attacked by two swarms of crows. 

One group of crows dies and the other is dispersed

[[Maxim]] looks at it and then tosses it. 

[[Huug]] and [[Drogon]] go up the hill and hear crying. We approach an individual and [[Drogon]] rolls a nat 20 and knows that it's a Korred. He says that "the stone reminded him of his love." [[Gromash]] rolls a nat 20 and knows that he is talking about a Kadlaka a raven woman. 

[[Drogon]] convinces him to put the stone back and he confesses that his name is [[Shaggy]]
