# Resting at the gathering
[[Grandfather Eiwa]] comes over and asks what mission we may do next. We say we're going to seek out Tapirs. He suggest we talk to [[Imek]] who works with the herding and is very knowledgeable. 

[[Imek]] shows up in the morning. She jabbers a lot about the different animals in the herd and their relationships. With the constant chatter it's hard to determine what she is saying. [[Aloga]] and [[Huug]] listen and get the feat tame animal. You must be trained in nature. [[Drogon]]

We fail in sneaking up on the tapirs but see that they have escaped some snares that may be poisoning. 

[[Aloga]] tames them and then [[Maxim]] removes the snares. We see the snares appear to be old ones that are similar to the [[The Broken Tusk|Broken Tusk]]. We also see some humanoid footprints. We see that these are very fresh. Then two burned orcs show up and challenge us. We defeat them but as the last the one dies he says with his dying breath that 
>"[[Ivarsa]] will end you traitors"

| Loot                       |

In the future we will have a snare training session with [[Whippa]]. 

# Water retrieval
After a long rest we are reminded about getting water. We are reminded by [[Selua]] that we have to take [[Pocano]]. Pocano dumps the ceremonial vessels on the ground without regard. 

Empty these are one bulk baskets. Filled they are 6 bulk. [[Huug]] picks up both water casks. 

When we go there is a cool spear. We do a mini game to challenge him for the spear and lose. He holds [[Drogon]] under the water until we tell him to stop. Off the spear is a banner of a mammoth on back of the flame with a orc hand hanging off it. [[Pocano]] says "feels like we could learn something." 

The water appears murky and filled with ash. We go up the stream to see if we can find fresh water until we see an island with a stump. 

We hear gurgling that appears to come from the river "are you hear to help me? I feel so bloated"

[[Gromash]] makes a great perception check and sees [[Kalbo]] who appears who is using magic to make the river talk.
