**Retcon:** *We will restart before the river scene in [[Session 2]]*.

We hear a gurling voice coming from the water "why have you come? Are you hear to help me?" 

[[Maxim]] can tell that the river movements are not natural and seem to be an effect of magic. [[Gromash]] spots a [[Lobloby]] on the island in the middle of the river. We are told that the solution to cleanse the river involves getting a flower from the mudpit on the south bank. 

[[Huug]] attempts to sneak up and grab the bird before it flies away. 

### Flower in the Mud
[[Drogon]], [[Gromash]], and [[Aloga]] attempt to get the flower. [[Gromash]] is able to get. They go back to the water spirit who tells them they need to eat a raw frog.

The "water spirit" then instructs [[Gromash]] to go into the water to experience the river's blessing. A water mephit appears and attacks him beginning combat.

## Training in snares
Upon arriving back at the gathering [[Whippa]] wants to teach the group about some new snares. A caltrop snare, battering snare and a poison barb snare. 

## Talking at the fire
[[Argakoa]] has been spending a lot of time learning stories from [[Grandfather Eiwa]] as his health is declining. It's likely that [[Letsua]] is likely learning from him and being prepared to take over leadership of [[Falcon House]]

## Speaking with Eiwa
In the [[Efgir]] we [[The Broken Tusk|Broken Tusks]] were called the [[Burning Mammoths]] carrying a bright light. Then the great quake shattered the eastern land and the demon hordes came. Some of us took the primordial flame and hid it. The others called us traitors and thieves. The left to fight the demon horde. Now the [[Burning Mammoths]] return. We cannot cancel the ceremony as this may put fear in the hearts of others and offend [[Sister Cinder]].

## Day of the ceremony
[[Grandfather Eiwa]] tells us that [[Pocano]] is from a very prestigious bloodline with his ancestors splitting. He feels he has a right to lead the group and that we should be more warlike.

We go to prepare for the day.

We scout ahead and clear the trail. Succeeding our checks we find a small [[Bloodseeker]] nest.

## Ceremony
We go to the standing stone and [[Merthig]] lights the bonfire. He goes on to speak about the water and fire. They are integral to our way. 
#### Announcements and Celebrations
[[Grandfather Eiwa|Eiwa]] announces the newest tusks. We approach the fire. We are each handed a pendant with our house animal. 

[[Pocano]] does not receive a pendant instead a friend item. He objects saying we should declare the next mammoth lord. He rants and raves. [[Grandfather Eiwa|Eiwa]] says tonight is not the time. 

A loud cry breaks the rant and we see torches, blood fiery faces crowd towards us and chaos ensumes.
